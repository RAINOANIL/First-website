<p>The popularity of anime has exploded in the West in recent years, with streaming services like <u>Crunchyroll</u> and<u> Netflix</u> having helped to introduce viewers to some of the many great hidden gems that the medium has to offer. This includes classic anime series as well, many of which were never broadcast in the West despite their overwhelming popularity in Japan.
</p>
<br>
<p>It is not easy to narrow down to only 10 anime and rank them,and there are many others that are worth watching outside this recommendation list, of course.</p><br><br>
LET'S START THE COUNTDOWN!



<h1>1.ONE PIECE </h1>
<br>

<br><p>It took a little longer for <b>One Piece </b>to establish itself in the West than it did for some of the other great Shonen anime series. Once it did though, it's never once struggled to keep Western audiences engaged. The same could be said of its popularity in Japan, with several generations having now grown up with the popular manga and anime series.<br>

    The former actually holds a Guinness World Record for the number of copies published by a single author and was the best-selling manga for eleven consecutive years between 2008 and 2018. The anime adaptation has proven to be equally successful though, and, save for the occasional small changes, has largely remained true to the source material - much to the delight of series fans.
    <br><br>Release Date - October20, 1999
    <br>Seasons -1
    </p>



<h1>2.NARUTO</h1>
<br>
<img src="https://i2.wp.com/wallpapercave.com/wp/wp8339083.jpg" alt="" srcset="" width="780" height="438" border="10">
<p><strong> Naruto</strong> started life in the Japanese publication Weekly Shōnen Jump. Following its successful debut in 1999, it was eventually adapted into an anime in late 2002. The resulting series ran for 220 episodes, with the first 135 following the first part of the manga and the rest telling their own original story using unused plot elements from creator Masashi Kishimoto's original ideas.<br>

    The series explores a variety of themes while also incorporating elements from Asian mythology. At its heart though, it tells the story of a young boy who dreams of becoming the leader of his village and his journey to becoming one of the greatest ninjas of all time. For those who just can't get enough, Boruto follows the story of Naruto's son and is set in the same world, but the original series arguably makes for a much better watch.
    <br><br>Release Date - October 3, 1999
    <br>Seasons -8

<h1>3.DRAGON BALL</h1>
<br>
<img src="https://images.hdqwalls.com/download/goku-in-dragon-ball-super-anime-4k-rnc-1920x1080.jpg" alt="" srcset="" width="780" height="438" border="10">
<p>When it comes to longevity, few IPs can compete with Akira Toriyama's <b>Dragon Ball</b>, which has managed to remain popular for almost four decades now. Granted, there were some dark periods during that time such as the 18-year window between the end of Dragon Ball Z and the beginning of Dragon Ball Super. Likewise, it would be foolish to try and argue that every arc or episode of Dragon Ball has been of the highest quality. Even so, the franchise has still managed to remain hugely popular both in Japan and in the West.<br>

    At its very best, there aren't many anime series that can come close to matching Dragon Ball in terms of entertainment, nor can many claim to have had such an emphatic impact when it comes to the popularization of anime in the West. For this last reason alone, many feel that Dragon Ball is one of the most important anime series ever made. Combine this with its fantastic storylines, incredible villains, and high-octane action scenes, and there's a very strong argument to be made for it being one of the best anime series of all time, if not the very best.

    <h1>3.BLEACH</h1>
    <br>

<p><b>Bleach</b> (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese anime television series based on Tite Kubo's original manga series of the same name. It was produced by Studio Pierrot and directed by Noriyuki Abe. The series aired on TV Tokyo from October 2004 to March 2012, spanning 366 episodes. The story follows the adventures of Ichigo Kurosaki after he obtains the powers of a Soul Reaper—a death personification similar to the Grim Reaper—from another Soul Reaper, Rukia Kuchiki. His newfound powers force him to take on the duties of defending humans from evil spirits and guiding departed souls to the afterlife. In addition to adapting the manga series it is based on, the anime periodically includes original self-contained storylines and characters not found in the source material.<br><br>

    Viz Media obtained foreign television and home video distribution rights to the Bleach anime in March 2006. Bleach was broadcast in the United States on Adult Swim from September 2006 to November 2014.
    <br><br>Release Date - September 9, 2006
    <br>Seasons -16

    <h1>4.ATTACK ON TITIAN </h1>
    <br>
    <img src="aot.avif" width="780" height="438" border="10>"
<p><br> Its plot may have become a little convoluted over the years, but <b>Attack on Titan</b> is still a great anime with a fantastic cast of characters and some wonderful story threads. The visuals are top-notch too, though those with an aversion to violence may wish to give this one a miss, as it's an incredibly gritty and gory affair right from the get-go.<br>

    The story centers around Eren Jaeger, who lives in a world in which humanity has been driven to the brink of extinction by a race of giant human-eating creatures known as Titans. After his hometown is destroyed and his mother eaten, Eren joins the Survey Corps and vows to rid the world of Titans. However, things quickly become more complicated as the story begins to unfold.
    <br><br>Release Date - September 28, 2013
    <br>Seasons -4
    </p>
    
    <h1>5.DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA</h1>
    <br>
    <img src="demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba-posters-wallpaper-2560x1440_51.jpg" width="780" height="438" border="10">
<p><b>Demon Slayer</b> may be relatively new, but that doesn't mean that it can't still be included in conversations surrounding the best anime series of all time. After all, it's been able to generate around $10 billion in revenue in the six years or so since its creation, which is around the same as more established media franchises such as Thomas the Tank Engine and Sesame Street; both of which have been around for well over half a century.<br><br>

    There are many reasons for Demon Slayer's phenomenal success, from its fantastic plot to its interesting cast of characters. The animation is outstanding too, helping to bring the source material to life in a way that very few other Shonen anime series have been able to. With more still to come, there's really no telling just how much higher Demon Slayer can climb, both in terms of its incredible commercial success and its widespread critical acclaim.
    <br><br>Release Date - January22, 2021
    <br>Seasons -4

    <h1>6.JUJUTSU KAISEN</h1>

    <img src="https://wallpapers.com/images/hd/jujutsu-kaisen-4k-anime-characters-hccbh0fp7rl24yd0.jpg" width="780" height="438" border="10">

    <p>A boy swallows a cursed talisman - the finger of a demon - and becomes cursed himself. He enters a shaman's school to be able to locate the demon's other body parts and thus exorcise himself.<br><br>
        Yuji Itadori, a kind-hearted teenager, joins his school's Occult Club for fun, but discovers that its members are actual sorcerers who can manipulate the energy between beings for their own use. He hears about a cursed talisman - the finger of Sukuna, a demon - and its being targeted by other cursed beings. Yuji eats the finger to protect his friends, and ends up becoming Sukuna's host. However, Yuji discovers that he has inherited magic and is able to control this power without interference from Sukuna. He joins the Tokyo Metropolitan Magic Technical College to consumes all of Sukuna's fingers, which will enable a full exorcism to take place that will free him.

    <h1>7.DEATH NOTE</h1>
    <br>
    <img src="https://wallpaperaccess.com/full/3101258.jpg" width="780" height="438" border="10">  
    <p>If you’re a newcomer to anime and don’t know where to begin, start with Death Note. Not only is the English dub just as good as the subtitled version (a real rarity), it’s got one of the most recognizable and 'Western' of arcs: good-guy-turned-bad, in the vein of Breaking Bad or Ozark.

        Light Yagami is a teenager who happens across the titular<b> ‘Death Note’</b>, a notebook that allows its user to kill anyone anonymously just by writing down their name. Light uses this power to bump off some of Japan’s most hardened criminals and, inevitably, starts to dream a little bigger. <br>
        
        As the net closes in on Light, a compelling cat-and-mouse game between himself and master detective L ensues. A breathless drama that will have you hooked until its very last scene, Death Note deserves to be spoken of in the same breath as some of television’s most talked-about prestige dramas.
        <br><br>Release Date - October21, 2007
        <br>Seasons -1
        </p> 
    <h1>8.FULLMETAL ALCHEMIST: BROTHERHOOD</h1>
    <br>
    <img src="https://getwallpapers.com/wallpaper/full/7/7/4/296915.jpg" width="780" height="438" border="10">
    <p>Possibly the greatest anime of all time? It’s not hard to see why <b>Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</b> is so revered thanks to its pitch-perfect blend of world-building, fantasy, action, and drama.

        After a ritual to bring back their dead mother goes wrong, Edward’s younger brother, Alphonse, loses his body and his soul is trapped inside a suit of armor. As they search for the Philosopher’s Stone, they are dragged into a mystic war waged across nations – and a conspiracy that leads to the very heart of their nation’s government.<br>
        
        FMA: Brotherhood’s greatest strength lies in its impeccable pacing. It starts off pretty low-key – including that infamous Nina episode – and soon spirals out into epic battles as the seven Homunculus and the mysterious Father stand in Edward’s way. It’s all wrapped up in final act that is so inherently bombastic and entertaining that it could only be brought to life in anime.
        <br><br>Release Date - April 5, 2009
        <br>Seasons -4
        </p>

        <h1>9.HUNTER X HUNTER</h1>
        <br>
        <img src="hxh.jpg" width="780" height="438" border="10">
        <p><b>Hunter × Hunter </b>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yoshihiro Togashi. It has been serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump since March 1998, although the manga has frequently gone on extended hiatuses since 2006. Its chapters have been collected in 37 tankōbon volumes as of November 2022. The story focuses on a young boy named Gon Freecss who discovers that his father, who left him at a young age, is actually a world-renowned Hunter, a licensed professional who specializes in fantastical pursuits such as locating rare or unidentified animal species, treasure hunting, surveying unexplored enclaves, or hunting down lawless individuals. Gon departs on a journey to become a Hunter and eventually find his father. Along the way, Gon meets various other Hunters and encounters the paranormal.
            <br><br>Release Date - April 17, 2016

    <h1>10.HAIKYU!!</h1>
    <br>
    <img src="https://wallpaperaccess.com/full/3869133.jpg" width="780" height="438" border="10">
    <p><b>Haikyu</b> follows the trials and tribulations of Hinata, a pint-sized volleyball player at Karasuno High harboring lofty ambitions to be the world’s best. The magic of Haikyu, though, is that you don’t need to be a fan of volleyball – or sport at all, really – to enjoy it. The show slowly builds up your understanding of the game alongside Hinata, and each season usually climaxes in epic matches that stand alongside any shonen anime in terms of raw emotion.<br>

        As Haikyu wears on, you’ll laugh, cheer, and gasp as Karasuno’s eclectic squad – including the miserly perfectionist setter Kageyama and nervous wallflower Sugawara – suffer through the highs and lows of high school volleyball. This is the perfect entry point for those who want to try out sports anime for the first time. The series is set to draw to a close later this year with two movies.
        <br><br>Release Date - April 6, 2014
